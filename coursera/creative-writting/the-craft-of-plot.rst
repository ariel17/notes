 The craft of plot
===================

What is plot?
-------------

Plot is the main events of a novel or story devised and presented by the writer
as an interrelated sequence. 

Main events mean what happens in your story, literally the actions or events
that occurred. 

Devised and presented as an interrelated sequence means the connected order in
which things happen in your story. 

The English author Forster defines the difference:

| "The king died And then the queen died" is a story, while "the king died and
| the queen died of grief is a plot". This implies a causal relationship
| between those two events: in the first description X happened and Y happened;
| there's no relationship between those two actions. It's like an itinerary of
| events that happened according to a timeline, but are not related to each
| other. In the second, the queen died because she was sad about the first
| thing that happened: those things are connected to each other.

**Exposition**
  Give your initial important background information about the story. Example:
  you can tell your readers information about setting, events that have
  occurred before the main plot of your story. Back story information about
  your characters, any information that might provide context for what your
  plot is about is exposition. 

**Inciting incident**
  Event that kicks off the action in your story. This event also informs the
  reader what the main conflict in your plot will be about. This is where we
  are introduced to our protagonist (that's your novels main character). After
  that the pyramid goes up, that's your rising action. This is an event or
  series of exciting events that start right after your inciting incident that
  builds up to your climax. Your plot is dependent upon these exciting events
  to set up the climax of your story. This is where we usually meet our
  antagonist (this is our protagonist's chief opponent). The antagonist of your
  story tries to put as many obstacles in your protagonist's way. 

**Climax**
  The biggest tension in your story. It's the most exciting event in your plot.
  This is everything that your rising action has built up to and sets sets up
  for all of the falling action that follows. Here's where your protagonist,
  your main character pushed up against the wall, finally reveals what they're
  made of.
  
**Falling action**
  Fallout from the big action that happened in the climax. This is also where
  we learned the conflict between your protagonist and the obstacles that have
  been put in their way. 

**Resolution**
  Where the protagonist, or main character, solves the main problem or
  conflict. Last, on the other end of the pyramid, the denouement, this is your
  ending. Any remaining secrets, questions, or mysteries which remain after the
  resolution is solved by the characters or explained by the author. 

How plot works in Harry Potter?
-------------------------------

Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Exposition**
  We're introduced to Harry and his horrible relatives, the Dursleys. We find
  out Harry is an orphan, and it's clear he's being mistreated by the Dursleys,
  especially concerning the odd incidents that seem to keep happening around
  him. Just before Harry's 11th birthday, letters are delivered to the house,
  which Harry's uncle intercepts with an increasing mania. Finally, after
  removing the family to a cabin on a remote island, just at midnight on
  Harry's birthday, Hagrid shows up to hand-deliver a letter that informs Harry
  he's a wizard.
  
**Rising action**
  This is where a majority of the book takes place. Harry learns what it means
  to be a wizard and starts discovering the wizard world. He also meets a few
  of his supporters, Hagrid, Ron, and Hermione and antagonists, Severus Snape
  and Draco Malfoy. We follow Harry through his first year in school where he
  faces the standard problems of a new student, getting lost on the way to
  class, trying out for the quidditch team, noticing mysterious happenings
  going on around the school. Ultimately, Harry, Ron, and Hermione reach an
  erroneous conclusion that Snape is trying to steal the sorcerer's stone and
  attempt to stop him. 

**Climax**
  Harry reaches the end of the teachers' set traps and puzzles and sees not
  Snape, but Professor Quirrell attempting to steal the stone by looking for it
  in the Mirror of Erised. During the climax, Quirrell reveals that he had
  tried to kill Harry earlier in the year at a quidditch match and that he'd
  released a troll into the school. Ultimately, Quirrell reveals that he's
  being possessed by Lord Voldemort who forces Harry to look in the mirror and
  find the stone. Harry gets the stone but refuses to give it to Lord Voldemort
  slash Quirrell. When Voldemort tries to take the stone from Harry, Harry
  passes out. 

**Falling action**
  Harry wakes up later to find out that Quirrell couldn't take the stone from
  him, likely because he's still under the protection of his mother's love,
  which saved him as a baby. Professor Dumbledore reveals that Voldemort left
  Quirrell to die, and that the stone has been destroyed. Resolution. The
  conclusion of the school year Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville win back on
  the house points they'd lost earlier by sneaking out of their common room,
  and Gryffindor wins the House Cup. 

**Denouement**
  Harry returns home to the Dursleys for the summer without letting them know
  he's not allowed to use magic outside of the school.
  
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Exposition**
  Harry wakes up in his bed at the Dursleys after having a vivid dream. His
  scar hurts enough that Harry feels the need to tell someone, so he dashes off
  a letter to Sirius Black. Harry then goes off to the World Cup with the
  Weasley family. Once Harry gets back to Hogwarts, he and the other students
  find out that the Triwizard Tournament is being held at their school this
  year, and any student over 17 is invited to apply.
  
**Inciting incident**
  Despite being under 17 and another champion from the school being chosen,
  Harry's name emerges from the goblet, as it represents a binding magical
  contract, Harry must compete. Rising action. The whole year Harry faces
  friendships falling in and falling out, his first crush, and the whole of the
  tournament. The final task in the tournament is a maze that each of the
  champions must try to get through to get the trophy in the middle. Harry and
  the other Hogwarts champions reach it together, so they decide to take it
  together. When they touch it, they are transported together to a graveyard.
  Immediately after arriving, Cedric is killed. 

**Climax**
  Harry recognizes Pettigrew, who ties Harry up and performs a ritual that
  raises Voldemort back into a corporeal form. Once he has a body back, he
  challenges Harry to a dual. Their spells cancel each other out, and this
  gives Harry enough time to grab Cedric's body and the portkey and transport
  back to Hogwarts. Falling action. Once back, Harry tries to explain what
  happened, but Mad-Eye Moody takes him away to his office. Once they are
  alone, it becomes apparent that Mad-Eye Moody is really Barty Crouch Jr., one
  of Voldemort's ardent supporters. Before he can kill Harry, Dumbledore rushes
  in and intervenes. Resolution. The real Moody is found, Barty Crouch Jr. is
  given the Dementor's Kiss, and Harry is declared the winner of the Triwizard
  Tournament.
  
**Denouement**
  Harry gives all his money to Fred and George to start a joke shop, and it is
  revealed that most people in the Ministry of Magic don't believe that Harry
  has seen Voldemort.
  
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Exposition**
  Harry is just about to turn 17, which is the age of majority for wizards. At
  this age, the protection on his aunt and uncle's house will be broken, so
  there is a very complicated plot hatched to move Harry safely from Privet
  Drive to Ron's house at the Burrow. They are attacked immediately upon
  leaving and suffer a few losses before making it to the Burrow.
  
**Inciting incident**
  There is a wedding celebration at the Burrow, but the night of the wedding
  the Ministry of Magic is taken over by Death Eaters. Ron, Hermione, and Harry
  barely escape, and from this point forward, they are on the run.
  
**Rising action**
  The majority of this book is spent with the trio hunting down the Horcruxes.
  They find the original locket fairly quickly, but have no way to destroy.
  They are dogged constantly by the threat of Death Eaters and catchers, and
  they are eventually captured and taken to Malfoy Manor. Dobby appears and
  rescues them, and it's at that point they realize that the rest of the
  Horcruxes they haven't found must be in Hogwarts, so they return. A massive
  battle ensues, but they manage to find and destroy the other Horcruxes.
  
**Climax**
  Harry offers himself to Voldemort who fires a killing curse at him while
  Harry just lets it happen. Voldemort thinks Harry is dead, but what's
  actually happened is that Voldemort has destroyed a piece of his soul that
  was inside Harry, leaving himself vulnerable to death. 

**Falling action**
  Harry pretends to be dead, and Voldemort walks into the castle with his body,
  triumphant at having defeated him. Of course, at this point, Harry reveals
  himself to be alive, and the real final duel takes place.
  
**Resolution**
  Harry urges Voldemort to feel some remorse for what he did, but instead,
  Voldemort fires a last killing curse at Harry. Harry uses a disarming spell,
  causing the killing curse to rebound and kill Voldemort.
  
**Denouement**
  The wizarding world returns to peace, and we see a future flash forward where
  Harry is sending his own kids off to Hogwarts.

Character + action = plot
-------------------------

| "There are only two plots in all of literature: someone goes on a journey and
| a stranger comes to town."

By John Gardner, an American novelist.

| "What drives animation is the will of the characters. You don't depict fate,
| you depict will."

By Hayao Miyazaki; one of Japan's most celebrated animators, director of
"Spirited Away", "Howl's Moving Castle", "Ponyo", and many others.

In both these examples, character is an integral component imply. Five key
questions you should ask when creating a great dynamic character:

**What do they want?**
  This is the first and most fundamental question you have to answer when
  creating a good character. All great characters want something. Kurt
  Vonnegut, author of Slaughterhouse Five and many other great novels and
  stories wrote that the first step in writing a good story was creating a
  character that wanted something. Even if that something was a simply a drink
  of water. Desire is a crucial component in creating a believable that we can
  follow. This is different from a character that needs something: a character
  that needs something is fate, a character that wants something is will.

**What are their weaknesses?**
  Many writers give their characters traits that make them honorable, virtuous,
  and in many cases invulnerable. Now while you may want to hang out with
  someone who's honorable or virtuous in real life, we don't really make for
  interesting characters on the page. Think of the list of the greatest
  characters in fiction: J Gatsby from The Great Gatsby, Holden Caulfield from
  The Catcher in the Rye, Harry Potter from the Harry Potter series. Each of
  these characters were more interesting to follow and to read about because of
  their weaknesses, not their strengths. Superman isn't an interesting
  character because he's invulnerable, Superman's an interesting character
  because he's vulnerable to kryptonite. So when compiling a list of traits for
  your characters, make sure that their weaknesses are more interesting than
  their strengths. 

**Where are they from?**
  There's both a literal answer for this and a deeper, more emotional answer.
  First the literal. What are your characters biographical information? What
  city, state, town, or country are they from? Did they grow up as a kid on the
  streets of New York City or were they born and raised in a farm in Indiana?
  Understanding this biographical information helps inform us of what a
  character wants because it can help us understand where they came from.
  
  Then, there's the more emotional answer.
  
**Where are they from?**
  As in, what is their emotional background? Did they have two loving parents?
  Or were they raised by a single, overworked mother? Did they lose a sister
  when they were very young? Were they bullied in junior high? Where are they
  from emotionally helps us understand a character's motivation for acting the
  way that they do. And it can be instrumental in helping us understand why a
  character desires a particular thing.
  
  It's also crucial in helping us answer the next question.
  
**Where are they going?**

  Pairing this question with where are they from gives you a complete character
  arc. That is, if I know why a character wants a particular thing and I
  understand where they're from, I have an understanding, not only of how hard
  they're going to try to get what they want, but how resilient they'll be when
  rising actions are put in their way to obstruct their path. I'll get to
  rising actions in a second.
  
  Last,
  
**what can your characters do to surprise you?**
  Now this may sound weird, but characters sometimes don't do what we expect
  them to do when we put them on the page. They act in a more resourceful way
  than you imagine. Or if they suspect they were walking into an ambush in a
  dark room, they might decide, just like an actual person, not to go into that
  room. Look for places in your story where your characters do things you
  didn't expect them to do, and encourage your characters by following them
  instead of trying to lead them. 

Now that you have a rough idea of what a character should look like, it's time
to give that character something to do. That's where rising actions come in.
Here is a simplest way to define what exactly is a rising action:

* Your main character wants something. Some obstacle, it can be another thing,
  another character, your main character's own flaws, gets in your main
  character's way of getting that one thing your character wants. 

* Those obstacles are rising actions. Your character overcomes these obstacles,
  these rising actions only to encounter even larger obstacles on the next
  level or in the next chapter. 

* That's the next rising action. So, like levels in a video game, your
  character has to keep overcoming obstacles. They have to keep overcoming
  rising actions until they reach the place where they can try and get what
  they want. 

* Once you have your character and your action, you essentially have the plot
  of your novel. 

Here's the best way I know to summarize plot, or the best way to answer someone
when they ask what your book is about. For this you'll need the inciting
incident, a character, the obstacle, and the quest.

Now how do you put it all together? 

When an inciting incident happens to character, they have to overcome conflict
slash obstacles, to complete quest. Now there are a lot of different ways of
structuring these basic elements, but that set up right there is the most
efficient way that I know to put them all together. This sentence construction
is also often called a pitch. That is the shorthand way to describe what your
book is about to an agent.

Assignment: The Escalator
-------------------------

Write a scene of 250-350 words featuring a character with one concrete want (a
table, a moose, a toothbrush, anything physical is fine!) and one weakness. Use
these two features to drive the action of the plot. Set up the story where
every other sentence is a rising action. To help you come up with rising
actions, use one word from the following list of twelve words in each sentence
that has a rising action. In other words: Write your first sentence introducing
your character. Make the next sentence a rising action using one of the
following twelve words. Write your third sentence, which may introduce the
weakness, then write your fourth sentence with a rising action that includes
one of the remaining eleven words you haven’t used. And so on.

* trick
* memory
* aboard
* tiger
* pretend
* carrot
* appliance
* cage
* rings
* crow
* filthy
* explode

You must use at least 6 of the 12 words, but you are encouraged to challenge
yourself to use as many of the words as possible while still meeting the word
count.
