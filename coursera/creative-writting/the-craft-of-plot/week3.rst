 Week #3: A scene in motion
============================

What is a scene?
----------------

Scenes are the building blocks of storytelling. But, what is a scene? and how
does a scene move flat forward? Anthony Doerr, author of the best selling novel
"All the Light We Cannot See", says his students always want to write about
quote, big things like love or getting lost or heartbreak, and they missed the
simple message of staying in the physical level all the time. 

That level is evoked through detail and according to Doerr:

| It's what let's an author quote, present an argument, that's the essence of
| rhetoric and that's what we're doing, we're arguing readers into believing
| the fiction we're making. 


The best way to get those details in your fiction is **through scenes.**
American writer Ernest Hemingway wrote scenes using what he called the *Iceberg
Theory.* He honed this theory from his time as a journalist: we had to cut
everything away except for the most essential details. The idea is we see only
a tip of what's happening to a character, but the substantial bulk of what
makes this character tick is like an iceberg hidden underneath the water.

Mike Nicholas, an American film director, responsible for such classic films as
"The Graduate" said that, all good scenes are essentially one of three things:

* An argument.
* A seduction.
* A negotiation.
  
In each of these examples, the characters involved have different agendas. Each
character wants something different, thus giving the scene a reason to exist.
Creating a great scene means pairing down to just the essentials; refer to the
phrase *show, don't tell.* When someone says that what they literally mean is
that they want a scene.

What goes in a scene?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scene must comply with a five point checklist of what all good scenes have,
much in the same way that your story or novel needs a five act structure in
order to maximize your storytelling abilities. Your scenes require five things
in order for a reader to feel that you're *showing* them something as opposed
to *telling* them something.

Scenes can have more elements but all scenes need at least the following five
points:

**Action**
  Scenes usually start with a specific action. This means something has to
  happen, an action is something concrete. An action is not reminiscing about
  something that happened to someone earlier in the day. It's not thinking
  about something or dreaming about something, or wishing about something. An
  action involves your character standing up and doing something. 

  If your character can accomplish what you've asked them to do sitting on a
  couch, that means it's probably not an action. If they need to get off that
  couch, you've probably got an action.

**Dialogue**
  Dialogue is not just what two characters say to each other. Like the
  difference between a story and a plot, dialogue is not a transcript of two
  people talking, nor where people say please or thank you or have a good day,
  nor introduce themselves by name. Dialogue should never just convey
  information. All dialogue, and in fact every sentence you write should do two
  things: deepen our understanding of the character speaking that dialog or
  advance the plot, or both. 

**Specific intimate details**
  About yourself, your surroundings, and the people you are writing about.
  Intimate means details that a reader will not be able to see or notice by
  themselves without your help. For example: 
  
  "The character walks into a strange room and is nervous because he's there to
  talk to his boss at his boss' house. Then he sees a gorgeous red velvet
  couch. The character then notes that there are scratch marks on the couch's
  corners. That means the person who owns this couch probably has a cat. This
  makes the character feel comfortable, because character likes cats. And the
  character likes cats because that character's favorite pet as a child was a
  house cat named Bujums."
  
  What happened:
  
  * The character noticed the scratches.
  * Realized there was a cat somewhere.
  * Shared with the reader how comfortable he felt because he recognized
    familiar scratch marks on the couch's corners and knew there was a cat
    there.
  * The character grew up with cats and relaxes because anyone that lets their
    cat scratch up a nice, beautiful red velvet couch must be a really relaxed
    guy.
    
  Specific intimate details.
  
**Inner point of view**
  What are you thinking, feeling and processing? The wonderful writer Ann Hood
  refers to this as *the three R: react, reflect or reveal.* Whenever it's time
  for a character to explain what they're feeling about a particular action, a
  proposition, another character or an obstacle in their path, they should do
  one of three things:

  * **REACT.** They do something active right in the moment. They kick down a
    door, they pick up a chair, they pull out a gun, etc. 

  * **REFLECT.** The character thinks about what they're faced with in the
    moment and internally weighs their options: "if they kick down the door,
    they could break their foot or there could be somebody there with a bar
    stool behind that door ready to hit them."
    
  * **REVEAL.** The character reveals something about themselves to the reader
    that helps us understand who they are, and how they're gong to respond to
    this action, proposition, character or obstacle. Perhaps the last time your
    character kicked down a door, he got shot in the leg so this time, he's
    going to look for an open window. 

**Definite starting point and a stopping point**
  Great scenes start with an action. They end when that action has been
  resolved in some way. So if your character scene started by trying to get
  into a house, the scene ends when your character has either got into the
  house or it's decided not to go into the house.

Shop Talk with Amity Gaige: How Setting and Description Make a Scene Come Alive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions
~~~~~~~~~

* **What is setting? What do we mean when we talk about description?**

  * Setting: the place and time in which a story occurs. Is sort of a
    description of time and place.
  
  * Description: the material and the words devoted to fleshing out that time
    and place. Is a foundation, I think of every aspect of a story.
    
    So, say, plot for example, it's a description of events, and character is a
    description of made up people. So I feel like description is really
    foundational.

* **Where does S & D fit into the template of creating a scene for the
  reader?**

  Trying to tell a good short story is like trying to convey a dream. And as
  private and as weird and random as dreams can be, when you try to tell that to
  someone who's listening to you, it's so hard for them to see it, because
  they're not in your head. And also, there's other problems like dreams are
  half-remembered, and it's kind of similar when you're writing a short story or
  a novel. Any work of fiction, It's really in your head as deep as a dream is.
  So it's so much effort and so much work on scene work to really transfer that
  dream from your head to the reader's. And that's what *show don't tell* means
  to me. Can you write all of the atmosphere and the logic and the sensory detail
  in your scene? And can you deliver that to someone else? Because if you can't,
  they can't really have the pleasure of reading. They don't really get to enter
  your dream with you. So scenes do that best, right? Because what exactly as you
  describe them, they're these moment by moment, play by play, recreations of
  interactions or events. And you have to do them as carefully and as
  thoughtfully of the reader as you can. What does the reader need to know,
  because that reader wasn't dreaming with me. 

* **Anthony Door talks about how a lot of people want to write about big ideas.
  Love, loss, heartbreak, etc. But they don't ground their stories in the
  physical world. And so getting those details, so you can write about
  heartbreak or you can write about somebody that has a cherished valentine in
  a desk drawer somewhere that they haven't looked at for 20 years. And because
  of that physical detail you're just able to connect more specifically with
  the large ideas. As opposed to I want to write a story about somebody who
  broke my heart. Because that usually results in a pretty bad story.**

  And you think that's going to be, in some ways, all you need, is the
  sentiment, and the feeling, and the passion. You do need that. But really, to
  have your dream or your story understood, you really need the physical
  details. And as Flannery O'Connor said, writing fiction is, she called it an
  *incarnational art.* Everything was physical. And she said if you don't want
  to get dusty, don't write fiction because we're made of dust. And I love her
  kind of grouchy way of putting that.
  
  I tracked down this Eudora Welty quote here: *Every story would be another
  story, and unrecognizable, if you took up its characters and plot, and made
  it happen somewhere else.* Fiction depends for its life on place. Place is
  the crossroads of circumstance, the proving ground of what happened, who's
  here, who's coming. How does setting inform our understanding of those
  questions of what happened, who's here, and who's coming? When you're writing
  a scene and you're placing your character in a physical scene: "Brando walked
  into the room and he saw the bookshelves and he heard the traffic and he felt
  the sun." These are ways that you're describing the scene. And later on as
  Brando continues and he goes through his series of events that are the plot
  of the story. Those details that you place in the scene, that you initially
  placed in the scene in the service of convincingness just to set it and make
  that dream feel real, become those very details that start to matter.
  Sometimes when we talk about symbols I think all we're talking about, a
  writer doesn't think of them as symbols. A writer thinks of them as details
  that he or she put into the scene. Sort of as a matter of fact, to color and
  paint the scene and then they start to behave. And they start to repeat. In a
  different answer to that question, there's the Chekhov quote in terms of
  plays: *Don't put a gun on the stage unless it's going to go off at some
  point during the play.* That happens when you set your scene and you put the
  books in the room or you put the traffic in and the sounds in the room. They
  come back. Later on in the scene they start to mean. They start to have
  narrative function too like then Brenda walked outside and waited for the
  bus.
  
  So I don't think that setting is remotely ornamental. It's integral to the
  scene. You start to describe it, and then it starts to behave. And it starts
  to become inextricable from the other things that happen in the story.
  
* **Where do details come from? Do they come from the powers of observation?
  Should we keep a notebook? Where do you get your details from for your
  work?**
  
  One thing I love about being a writer is my active participation with my
  imagination, which is technically infinite. Right, I can imagine anything.
  And I can imagine great quantities of things. So generally whenever there is
  a deficit of detail I know that it's the writer or the learner not waiting,
  not exploring that imagination. Because I think that everybody has those
  details in his or her imagination. Because it is the most, one of the most
  powerful things we have as a human being. And what other kind of animals
  don't have. So, if you take the time, and it's what I call *imaginative
  research,* and I talk about it in my module. Is that you need to sit, in some
  ways you kind of meditate on the scene. You can close your eyes, or you can
  keep them open. You can even write it down, and you're just actually, without
  even, without writing your story, you're imagining the world. You're just
  walking through it, projecting your way into this world. And the details will
  be there, because your imagination is one of the most incredible things about
  you.
  
* **Can you give us the best advice that anyone has given you about setting or
  description, be it a writing mentor or someone in your family? I know that in
  my conversation with Salvatore Scibona, he said that the first piece of
  advice that he got as a writer was from his grandmother. I think he was
  working on a novel when he was six or seven years old. And she said, "well it
  needs more dialogue." Do you have something similar?**
  
  There's a wonderful quote from Elizabeth Bowen and that is: *nothing happens
  nowhere.* You may think before you get to this course, when I think of I
  ve gotta set my story in a really exotic place, which you could do. But
  really you already have a setting as soon as you have a story. And that could
  be a room. That could be a bedroom. There are many kinds of rooms, right, and
  they're all so different. The difference between a bedroom and a kitchen is
  large. And so the woods is a setting. An elevator is a setting, and nothing
  happens nowhere. So just become aware of it. If you're aware of it and you're
  generous with your description, you give it to the reader. Then it will be a
  fascinating one. It doesn't have to be exact. 
  
  If you have a setting, you have a story.

Assignment: Show, don't tell
----------------------------

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with the first assignment, you will create another scene where someone wants
a concrete physical object more than anything else in the world. This time,
instead of focusing on rising action entirely, consider the full story
structure.

Write for a few minutes, then give that character a disease where they learn
they have only 24 hours to live. This is your first significant rising action.

Write some more, then give that character a choice between that object and an
antidote. This is your second significant rising action.

Finish the story with a conclusion. Your final story should not exceed 500
words. If you are considering participating in the capstone and have a larger
story in mind, you can consider this an opportunity to write one scene from it,
but remember your reader will not have any outside context.
