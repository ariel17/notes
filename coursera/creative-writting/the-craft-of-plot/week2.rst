 Week #2: The Power of Structure
=================================

What is structure?
------------------

Aristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher who wrote a book called Poetics,
where he argued plot or mythos was the most important element of drama.
Aristotle is credited with inventing the three act structure:

**The beginning**
  This is where you set up your characters, their relationships, their wants
  and desires.
  
**The middle**
  This is where the plot reaches its climax. 

**The end**
  This is where the plot is resolved. 

Today, modern screenplay writers use a three act structure when putting
together scripts. The ancient Roman lyric poet Horace can be given credit for
devising the five act structure. In a poem called Ars Poetica, Horace offers
advice on how to write poetry and drama. Specifically, he argued that a play
should not be longer or shorter than five acts.

In talking about structure for novels and short stories, I also follow a five
act structure, that while owing credit to Aristotle and Horace, is a lot more
modern. Emma Mott is an American author who wrote a wonderful book on the craft
of writing called Bird by Bird. In it, she describes a conversation that she
had with the novelist, Alice Adams about a unique five act structure Alice uses
called **A B D C E**. Let's take a look at what each one of these letters
stands for:

**A stands for action**
  Action is what draws the reader in. It's something specific and concrete.
  Lots of stories open up with a character thinking about something or doing
  something passive. That's not an action, an action is something physical that
  involves a character doing something. 

**B is for background**
  Background is essentially context, or what was happening to these characters
  before the story started. This is the part of the story where we get
  essential and vital information that will help us determine the character's
  actions as we go through the story. 

**D is for Development**
  This is where the meat of your story is. This is where the plot of your story
  happens because it's in this area where your characters deal with the rising
  actions you throw their way. And it's up to the characters to develop
  themselves and their responses in either succeeding or failing to overcome
  the obstacles in their path. 

**C stands for climax**
  The climax is where the biggest rising action happens in your story. This is
  the place where the key narrative twist in your story happens. And because of
  that twist, things are different for your main characters in a real and
  significant way. 

**E is for your ending**
  This is where we learn that the characters we thought we knew have become
  someone else because of their journey. 

Now each of these sections can be of any length, though endings are usually
short. Good stories are a circle or a spiral. They leave us back in the same
place but changed in some way. If you were to diagram this spiral, you'll see
that the tail end of the spiral goes out further than the spiral starting
point. This means your main character wanted something but didn't get it, or
they got it, but they were unexpected consequences. 

Example
~~~~~~~

Suppose you have a house cat, let's call your cat Bugens, a large orange and
white tabby. One day your partner decides to leave you because Bugens is
getting in the way of your relationship. This is your action. Remember, the
action thaat kicks off of your story is usually dramatic. 

Now you have Bugens because your kid brother, who was a soldier that died in a
war, gave him to you to take care of. This is your background. It's the context
that offers vivid and crucial information that helps us determine our main
character's action throughout the story. 

Now let's develop our story with Bugens. Bugens is indeed high maintenance. He
has a chronic sneezing condition that causes him to expel thick green strands
of snot on his food bowl, his water fountain, even on your face and in your
mouth, if he times his sneezing just right. He's also developed diabetes,
meaning he requires injections twice a day at exactly the same time. Meaning
you can't stay out with your boy or girlfriend beyond a certain time, because
you have to go back home and give Bugens his shots. 

You realize that your boy or girlfriend has a point about him being high
maintenance, but Bugens has been with you for years and has helped you through
many crises. And because of the promise you made to your dead brother, the war
veteran, getting rid of Bugens isn't an option. 

Now remember, the development is where you outline what your characters want
and what's standing in their way. 

Now it's time for the climax, this is the key narrative twist in your story.
This is where you bring all the threads of your story together. You invite your
boy, girlfriend back to your house and offer to cook a conciliatory dinner.
While you're in the kitchen, Bugens attacks your boy, girlfriend, who then
contracts rabies. You now have to make a decision. Lose your partner for good,
or get rid of Bugens. The ending, now this is what happens to your characters
after the climax. 

You decide to honor your commitment to your brother and keep Bugens. You never
see your boy or girlfriend again, but you and Bugens, after several trips to
the vet, live happily ever after. 

ABDCE structure examples from famous works of literature
--------------------------------------------------------

F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Action**
 Our main character, Nick Carraway, moves to Long Island, renting a house in
 the fictional village of West Egg and takes a job in New York City as a bond
 salesman.

**Background**
  Nick's cousin is Daisy who's married to a man named Tom Buchanan, a college
  acquaintance of Nick's. 

**Development**
  Nick meets the mysterious and enigmatic Jay Gatsby, who once had a romance
  with Daisy, and spends the summer in Gatsby's world. Daisy and Jay rekindle
  their romance and start an affair. Nick learns through a woman he's dating
  that Tom has a mistress named Myrtle Wilson. When Tom realizes Daisy is in
  love with Gatsby, Tom confronts Gatsby and reveals to Daisy that Gatsby made
  his fortune through bootlegging. Tom then sends Daisy and Gatsby back to West
  Egg. 

  Note how every line of summary here is literally another rising action.
  
**Climax**
  The key narrative twist in your story that brings all the threads together.
  Gatsby's car, driven in a reckless rage by Daisy, kills Tom's mistress.
  
**Ending**
  Now, what happens to your characters after the climax? Gatsby is murdered by
  Myrtle's husband, and Nick leaves Long Island in a complete state of
  disillusionment, and moves back to the Midwest. 

Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Action**
  Romeo is taken by his cousin Benvolio to a Capulet ball where he meets and
  instantly falls in love with Juliet. 

**Background**
  Romeo's family, the Montagues, and Juliet's family, the Capulets, are sworn
  enemies. 

**Development**
  Romeo and Juliet, after a whirlwind courtship, decide to get married.
  Juliet's cousin Tybalt, incensed that Romeo snuck into the Capulet party,
  challenges him to a duel. Romeo refuses to fight, so his friend Mercutio
  accepts the duel on Romeo's behalf. Tybalt kills Mercutio, so Romeo kills
  Tybalt and is exiled.
  
**Climax**
  Romeo returns from exile and sees Juliet in the tomb. Thinking she's dead, he
  kills himself. Juliet turns out not to be dead, only in a death-like coma due
  to a potion provided to her by a friar. When she awakens, she discovers Romeo
  is dead, then kills herself too.

**Ending**
  The friar that gave Juliet her potion tells the entire story to both the
  Montagues and the Capulets, who agree to at last end their grudge. 

Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Action**
  Harry Potter an orphan that's being mistreated by his horrible aunt and
  uncle, the Dursleys, learns just before his 11th birthday via a
  hand-delivered message from a half giant named Rubeus Hagrid that Harry is a
  wizard. 

**Background**
  We learn that a great and terrible wizard, Lord Voldemort, murdered Harry's
  parents, but vanished when he tried but failed to kill Harry Potter when he
  was an infant. Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and Hagrid place
  Harry in the care of his Muggle uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley.
  
**Development**
  Now this is where a majority of the book takes place. Harry learns what it
  means to be a wizard and starts discovering the wizard world. He also begins
  to meet a few of his supporters, Hagrid, Ron, and Hermione, and antagonists,
  Snape, and Draco Malfoy. We follow Harry through his first year in school
  where he faces the standard problems of a new student, getting lost on the
  way to class, trying out for the quidditch team, noticing mysterious
  happenings going on around the school. 

  Ultimately, Harry, Ron, and Hermione reach an erroneous conclusion that Snape
  is trying to steal the Sorcerer's stone and attempt to stop him. 

**Climax**
  The climax comes when Harry reaches the end of the teacher's set traps and
  puzzles, and sees not Snape, but Professor Quirrell attempting to steal the
  stone by looking for it in the mirror of Erised. During the climax, Quirrell
  reveals that he had tried to kill Harry earlier in the year at a quidditch
  match, and that he'd released a troll into the school. Ultimately, Quirrell
  reveals that he's being possessed by Lord Voldemort, who forces Harry to look
  in the mirror and find the stone. Harry gets the stone but refuses to give it
  to Voldemort/Quirrell. When Voldemort tries to take the stone from Harry,
  Harry passes out. Harry wakes up later to find out Quirrell couldn't take the
  stone from him, likely because he's still under the protection of his
  mother's love, which saved him as a baby. Dumbledore reveals that Voldemort
  left Quirrell to die and that the stone has been destroyed. 

**Ending**
  The conclusion of the school year, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville win back
  all the house points they lost earlier by sneaking out of their common room,
  and Gryffindor wins the house cup. Harry returns home to the Dursleys for the
  summer without letting them know he's not allowed to use magic outside of
  school. 

Assignment: What's up, Doc?
---------------------------

Write a very short story -not more than 200 words- about a trip to the doctor
or dentist using the ABDCE structure. Identify the structural elements in your
story. My example is in the assignment introduction video, and reproduced
below:

*One night when I was eight years old I opened a bag of Doritos to eat while*
*watching television. (A) Doritos were my favorite snack to eat as a child.*
*Nacho Cheese was my favorite flavor. (B) I loved sitting in the dark*
*hearing the "crunch, crunch, crunch" of the chips. I’d sit there, crunching*
*my chips, but didn’t eat the chips with a napkin (what kid does?) and would*
*forget about the powder that accumulated on my fingertips. As it got later*
*and I got sleepier, I kept rubbing my eyes, my fingertips covered in*
*Doritos Nacho Cheese powder. (D) When it was time for bed, I went to brush*
*my teeth, looked in the mirror, and saw two large bags under my eyes. The*
*Doritos Nacho Cheese powder had pooled into two large sacks underneath my*
*eyeballs. I started screaming and crying. (C) The next day, my grandmother*
*took me to the doctor who put industrial strength eye drops into my eyes to*
*flush out the powder. (E)*

Remember, the action in this story isn’t the actual doctor’s office visit. The
action is what LEADS you to the doctor’s office.
