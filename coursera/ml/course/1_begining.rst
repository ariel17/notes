Machine learning definition
===========================

* Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers
  the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* Tom Mitchell (1998): Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said
  to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance
  measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with
  experience E.

Machine learning algorithms
===========================

* To be seen on this course:

  * Supervised learning
  * Unsupervised learning

* Others:

  * Reinforcement learning
  * Recommender systems

Also talk about: Practical advice for applying learning algorithms.

Supervised learning
===================

It assumes that the values given to learn are the right answers to the given
question.

Regression problems
-------------------
It tries to predict continuous valued output. Example: predict a house sell
price.
      
Classification problems
-----------------------

It tries to assign a discrete value (classification) for a given output.
Example:

.. math::
   Cancer \rightarrow {benign=0, malign=1}

Unsupervised learning
=====================
